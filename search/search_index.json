The basic scheme is very simple and based on the following ideas: \u2212 Each motor rotates a pulley (P) \u2212 A (optionally coated) cable is twined around the pulley. The cable is fixed to the pulley by passing through a hole in the pulley (H). \u2212 The cable exits the motor by passing trough holes H1 and H2. \u2212 The cable enters into a tube (T1, T2, T3, T4) which guides its path trough the wrist. All the tubes are positioned on suitable sockets in correspondence of the holes (H1, H2). \u2212 Optionally the cable passes trough tensioners (Te1 and Te2) in between T1/T2 and T3/T4. Again the tensioners are provided with suitable sockets. \u2212 The cable exits the tube by entering into holes H3 and H4 once more equipped with suitable sockets for the tubes. Refer to the following example pictures: 1.1 General Rules to be Followed \u00b6 When mounting cables, pay attention to the fact that rotating the motor in a clockwise direction should correspond to a closure of the finger. The definition of clockwise rotation is given in the picture below. This rule is valid for all joints but distal joints; in the case of distal joints the closure of joints depends on some issues that will be discussed later on. 1.2 General Tips and Tricks \u00b6 \u2212 The uncoated cable is a bundle of smaller wires. When the cable is cut, this bundle may be corrupted (especially at the cable ending) by trying to pass the cable trough holes. A drop of glue on the cable ending may be useful. \u2212 Ideally the cable should be twined around the pulley P exactly at the middle of it. In particular, when the joint is in the middle of its range of movements the cable should leave the pulley P exactly at the level of the holes H1 and H2. If this is not the case, the friction of the cable at the level of H1 and H2 may break the cable after short usage. \u2212 Always check that the tubes are inside their sockets. If this is not the case cables will break easily due to high friction in correspondence of the input and output holes. \u2212 The tension of the cable is fundamental for having fingers working correctly. Always consider the possibility of using tensioners for increasing the cable tension. 2 WHAT DO I NEED TO CABLE \u00b6 Here you will find the overall table describing the the mandatory sheaths to be used in the correct place.

The motor rotates so as to move the slider (clockwise rotations correspond to moving the slider proximally, i.e. closer to the elbow). The slider pulls a couple of wires so as to close the ring and little finger. These 2 fingers are so actuated by 3 wires - 2 for the distal cables inside the fingers and 1 inside the motor shaft which moves the slider. The 2 cables needed for the R&P Distal Joint (from slider to fingers) are IITCODE 2391 and the 1 cable needed for the slider movements is IITCODE 1815 . The sheaths needed are: Dimension Label Notes 60(mm) 0-S or 0- Exits the motor case from the hole closer to the motor. Enters the hole in the slider near the hand (H5) 80(mm) 0+L Exits the motor case from the hole close to the ball bearing and arrives to the tensioner 73(mm) 0+S Exits from the tensioner and enters the hole in the slider near the elbow (H4) 112(mm) 2 Exits from the slider (H10) and enters the finger which is closer to the hole - ring. 112(mm) 9 Exits from the slider (H11) and enters the finger which is closer to the hole - pinkie. Tip Before connecting the sheath to the support insert and exit the cable, otherwise after this operation it would be more complicated. Here you can see the schematic of the cabling. The sheaths entering the fingers are represented in blue, while the sheaths for the slider movement are in red. The gray block is the tensioner. Please follow this link for an extended HOWTO route the cable. 4 HOW TO CABLE - WRIST \u00b6 The wrist movements (roll, pitch and yaw) are achieved with three motors located in the forearm. The wrist roll (or pronosupination) is achieved directly, i.e. without any cable driven joint. The wrist pitch and yaw are instead cable driven. The actuation is achieved with two motors which jointly collaborate to the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom. The actuation is differential with the following relationship: wrist_pitch = M1 wrist_yaw = M1 + M2 where M1 and M2 are the angular positions of the the two motors contributing to the movements. Wrist motors left arm Section view left arm The overall cables of the wrist are all build from IITCODE 1815 with the following specifications: IITCODE Alias/Provider Code Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. dia 0.63mm, not coated, AISI 316 4.1 Wrist Motor tendons \u00b6 From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the tendons inside the Right Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons.

REMOVE the excess with a tissue - double check that the knot is perfectly dry before to proceed. cut the excess of cable FINISHED!!! Insert the knot until it remains inside the socket of the pulley 2.2.3 Thumb \u00b6 Here you can find a procedure for recabling the Thumb Distal Joint of the right hand of the robot. WATCH OUT FOR the Left forearm : the motor positions are \"mirrored\" respect to the right ones. Pictures step by step guide In order to recable this joint, just insert the new cable IN side the hole (red circle - blue arrow) - the hole is in the internal side of the pulley cage. Once inserted, the cable should get OUT at the base of the phalange (red arrow). From the base of the phalange, insert the cable in the two pulleys following the path (red), ensuring that the cable remains parallel while looping (see bottom picture). For closing the cable, make it exit from the hole at the base of the nail and secure it in its socket with a knot 1-2cm away from the exit of the nail. By using a flat screwdriver the size of the throat, turning it the direction shown above (front view of the hand with palm down): you should be able to see the cable get sucked up until finally you can see the finger closing entirely. Make sure the finger can easily get closed and opened by turning CW and CCW from mid range closing.

WATCH OUT FOR the Left forearm : the motor positions are \"mirrored\" respect to the right ones. Pictures step by step guide You must consider to move away the slider which covers both motors, to be able to see clearly the hole where the cable will go - for that purpose, please remove the 4 screws indicated in the picture. After having removed the screws you should be able to move sideways the slider, being able more easily to fit the cable into the retaining socket, but mainly see both internal holes (blue circle for middle distal and red circle for index distal). Put the cable inside the correct hole, depending on which cable you are going to restore (middle finger - red hole & index finger - blue hole). Push it until it gets OUT from the base of the first phalange of either index or middle depending on the cable you want to fix. Twin the cable as shown and make a knot 1-2cm away from the exit of the nail. By using a flat screwdriver the size of the throat, turning it the direction shown above (front view of the hand with palm down): you should be able to see the cable get sucked up until finally you can see the finger closing entirely. Make sure the finger can easily get closed and opened by turning CW and CCW from mid range closing. FINISHED!!! 2.2.5 Ring and Pinkie \u00b6 These 2 fingers actually form a single distal joint and are in fact driven by a single motor. Note Those fingers need to be done together in order to make sure that both cable close simultaneously. The 2 fingers are so actuated by 3 wires - 2 for the distal cables inside the fingers and 1 inside the motor shaft which moves the slider. For each cabling please follow the procedures below. 2.2.5a Cabling for the fingers \u00b6 Pictures step by step guide 1.

To be able to pass the cable at the base of the nail it is important to create space by removing the nail (plastic cover) and moving forward the fingertip for 1 cm from its base. 6. please write with a marker at the base of the nails where the knot should be in order to have a perfect synchronous closing for both fingers. 7. Now close manually the 2 fingers to get some slack to the cable and pull it out a bit to see where you should create the knot - at the very end of the mark on the cable. 8. If you did good, when releasing the fingers they should be symmetrical FINISHED!!! 2.2.5b Cabling for the motor side \u00b6 Here you can find the procedure for the cabling of the motor side - responsible for the slider movement: Pictures Steb by step guide Put an about 6 mm thickness piece in between the slider and the Ergal part (yellow). Take one meter of cable IITCODE 1815 and start cabling along the pulley with cage already on: - 1 turn around the pulley for the motor side - 3 turns around pulley for the ball bearing side Make sure that the cables goes out of the pulley from both holes tangentially to the pulley. Insert the sheaths 0+S (ball bearing side) and 0-S (motor side). Assembly the motor passing the cable with 0-S sheath in the Ergal part - central hole, hand side (H5). Pass the cable with the 0+L sheath through the two motors under the slider, put a tensioner and the 0+S sheath and pass through the central hole of the Ergal part (cable should get out from H4), elbow side. At that moment the 2 sides of the cable get out, one from H4 and other side out of the Ergal part H5. Now pass the cables inside the slider superior and inferior holes: from H5 to H7 and from H4 to H6. Keeping straight the fingers with the piece of about 6 mm thickness inserted, tension the (0+S) cable and mark it with a pen, afterwards pull the slider backwards (the finger getting closed) and make a knot where there is the pen mark. Close the fingers (electrically) with the motor providing \u00b1 5.5 Volt and make the knot nearer than possible to the slider. 3 Proximal Joints \u00b6 3.1 Location \u00b6 Below you can see the back views of the forearms (palm down). The motor positions are mirrored. LEFT FOREARM RIGHT FOREARM real pic real pic If ever you realize that one of the following cable is broken bear in mind: Tip The start of the wiring for each proximal is identical (wiring around the motor pulley), the index and middle proximal joints are cabled exactly the same way, just the thumb is a bit trickier. 3.2 Cabling \u00b6 3.2.1 Preparation \u00b6 The minimum requirement to start recabling the proximal joints is: IITCODE Alias Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. dia 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 3.2.1 Cabling of the motor pulley & fingers \u00b6 Let' start with the cabling of the motor pulley. Pictures step by step guide Take 1 meter of IITCODE 1815 The following steps are common for the three fingers (index, middle, thumb). However, the holes for the thumb in the frame are slightly different (see next table). Turn the pulley in order to have the threads already facing (pointing toward) the holes inside the pink frame and the hole inside the pulley itself lying at horizontal. insert the cable inside the pulley and equitably half the cable on both side of the pulley. Respect the only one rule: 2 full turns around the pulley for the hole close to the ball bearing (blue cable) and 1 full turn for the part of the cable that will go into the hole the closest from the motor (red cable). Tip YOU may need to use the cable , glue it a the tip (2 cm long) on both side. With a plier make 2 times 90 degree angles on the cable at about 3-4 mm from one another. see picture to manage to extract the cable once it passes in between the thread and the neck of the frame. !!!PICTURE NEEDED!!!! Now we proceed with the cabling of the fingers. Pictures step by step guide After wrapping the cable on the pulley as shown before, insert the two cable extremities inside the frame holes for the Index & Middle. For the thumb, the frame holes are designed inclined by 45 deg, therefore the cables will not enter the frame perpendicularly as the previous case. Push the two sides of the cable inside the sheath (+) and (-) for each finger. The 2 sides of the cables should get out: For the Thumb: the cables exit from the base of the finger and enter inside two sheaths. For Index & Middle the cables exit at the base of their respective finger. Final cabling: For the Thumb, pass the cables around the pulley as shown. Start with the blue one. Fix the ends of the cables with a knot. Same procedure for the other fingers and make a knot at the end. FINISHED!!! Tip The final cabling is tricky. First, remember to CLOSE the tensioner of each cable before starting the cabling. If you leave the tensioners open, the cabling will not work. For making the final knot, put a mark on the blue cable and knot it. Slowly turn the motor CCW/CW while pulling the red extremity, ensuring that the cable is correctly running on the motor pulley. When the finger is completely closed pull the red cable and put a mark where the knot will be. Proceed by making the knot the closest to the mark. Finally, you can use the tensioners for removing the slack.","title":"Lower Arm V1"},{"location":"icub_tendons/lower_arm_V1/#howto-repair-any-cable-from-a-forearm-or-hand-version-1","text":"","title":"HOWTO REPAIR ANY CABLE FROM A FOREARM or HAND - VERSION 1"},{"location":"icub_tendons/lower_arm_V1/#1-overview","text":"Let's have an overview of the mechanical CAD from different view angles.

Insert the cable inside the pulley and equitably half the cable on both sides of the pulley. In order to differentiate the two cable parts, we will call them red and blue. !!!TIP!!! In order to keep in position the cable split in two halves, pull it like shown in the last pic Respect the only one rule: 2 full turns around the pulley for the hole close to the ball bearing (blue cable) and 1 full turn for the part that will go into the hole the closest from the motor (red cable). In order to keep the cable in position after the turns, you can push it with a screwdriver like shown in this last picture Tip YOU may need to glue the cable at the tip (2cm long) on both sides. With a plier make 2 times 90 degree angles on the cable at about 3-4mm from one another, in order to create a hook. Extract the cable once it passes between the thread and the neck of the frame. Tip When inserting the cable in the pulley, make sure that the pulley holes are in phase with the frame holes. In other words, the pulley threads need to be aligned with the 2 holes in the frame. LOCATION step by step guide !!!!WARNING!!! the cabling for the thumb passes first by a pair of pulleys before returning to a perfectly identical cabling as Index and Middle. After wrapping the cable on the pulley, insert the 2 cable extremities inside the frame holes. For the thumb, the frame holes are designed inclined by 45 deg.

You first need to replace the broken cable(s) by starting to enter the head crimp (4mm size \u2013 smaller one or ball crimp) of the cable 7 and 8 inside their respective tensioner. You will need later to start wiring cable 7 and 8 in their future path BUT to do so it is necessary to create SPACE FOR THE CRIMPS TO PASS. There are 2 designs for the shoulder so it is necessary to see the difference in between both of them to know how to untighten the good pieces and screws to create that SPACE VERSION 1 Remove the beige pulley (remove the 4 screws M2x12) until you don't remount cable 5 Reach the 2 screws M4x12 on the green pulley and just untighten them until you can pass both crimp 8 and 7 following the routing explain below.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE If you have only the cable 12 broken please proceed directly to 2.3 Whatever the other cases of figure you run into, the only way to substitute/replace the broken cables is to follow the next steps. 2.1 CHEST, BACK and BACK PACK COVERS DISMOUNTING \u00b6 A - CHEST cover removal pictures step by step guide STEP 1: remove the 6 screws M2x5 (red arrows) (3 on each side of the skin patch of the chest cover) If you do not have skin on torso cover go on to the next step. STEP 2: flip over the skin in order to access the 2 screws beneath it. Remove the 2 screws M3x6 STEP 3: hold the chest cover and remove the 2 crews M3x8 at the level of the shoulder (green circles) pictures of the connector STEP 4: disconnect the the electrical cable connecting the robot to the skin board inside the cover If you do not have skin on torso cover go on to the next step. depending of your version you will need to move sideways the back cover or the backpack. version without backpack B1 - NO BACKPACK VERSION pictures step by step guide STEP 1: Unscrew the power cord on the back of iCub (black circle) STEP 2: Remove the 2 ring screws (green circles) STEP 3: remove the 4 screws M3x6 to be able to move sideways the back cover B2 - BACKPACK VERSION pictures step by step guide picture of robot with connections STEP 1: disconnect the overall cables attached to the back pack -> STEP 2: remove the top cover of the back pack some version have a screw in the yellow circle some just a magnet If you have the version with the screw - remove it and just flip the cover and you are done. STEP 3: Either you use the real battery pack -> untighten the 2 lateral screws or the dummy battery pack -> remove the 2 lateral screw M2.5x10. STEP 4: slide the 2 two pieces and remove them STEP 5: remove the buttons' cache by unmounting the screw M2x6 STEP 6: loose the 2 screws M2.5x8 holding the switches/ethernet board and push it inwards !!!NEED PICTURE TO SHOW THAT!!! STEP 7: On the previous mention board, try to pop out the stand-off above the 2 push buttons. they will be in the way when we will try to remove the backpack cover later on, we may break them if remove wrongly STEP 8: remove the 4 screws (red circles) holding the back pack in place. NECK : 2 screws M3x8 bottom back pack cover : 2 screws M3x12 Theoretically, you should already have removed the 2 ring screws but if you forget, please do it now!! STEP 9: remove the backpack watch out!!! STEP 10: disconnect the 3 connectors (2 on switch board - to drive the 2 fans atop the backpack- and 1 on power board to drive the fans on the right side of the backpack) STEP 11: cut the tie wrap -> the back cover can be left away until we will need to remount it STEP 12: remove the 4 screws holding the battery pack holder. 2 screws M3x8 (yellow circle) 2 screws M3x6 (red circle) !!! the battery pack holder can move almost freely from now on !!! YOU would probably asking me why did we need to remove all of this for? And the answer is that unfortunately the cover are preventing us for either tense the cables or access to some pieces. IF YOU HAVE ** ONLY **CABLE 13 BROKEN JUST GO DIRECTLY HERE C - remove the back pulley Watch once the pulley or one side of the cable 13 is remove the rotation of the torso is totally free, someone else help is more than appreciated to hold it firm. what we have what we want pictures step by step guide STEP 1: loose the screws inside of the tensioners to get some slack on the cable. You should be able to make he cable jump around the STEP 2: You should be able to make the cable jump over the pulley STEP 3: Remove the central screw of this pulley RC_TLR_001_P_243 STEP 4: Use 2 fat flat screwdrivers to make the pulley popping up. -> photo needed D- create the require space pictures step by step guide In order to change the cable 11, it is necessary, when you still have the upper body attached to the robot to create some space in between those 2 pieces to be able to fit the cable that you need to replace. STEP 1: Remove the central piece which will hold the cable 11. 4 screws M2.5v5 STEP 2: Untighten just enough to have 2mm gap in between the head screw and the plate STEP 3: Untighten just enough to have 2mm gap in between the head screw and the plate STEP 4: You should be able to move slightly the upper body from the torso and create some space (2mm max - just the minimum required to pass the body of the cable in between the 2 pieces). 2.2 WAIST BACK - Cable 11 \u00b6 Warning routing cable 11 is quite simple in process of construction because you don't have yet the upper body mounted atop of the waist BUT become particularly tedious in phase of repair due to the presence of this latter. If you haven't removed the cover above the torso and the back (or backpack cover), please follow this link Procedure: Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place the cable onto the slot of the pulley (Photo 1). Put the squared plate above the cable and secure it with 4 screws with hexagonal head size M2.5x5 (Photo 2) Warning For people having the upper body still hanging CLOSE the gap Turn the cable around the pulley taking care to cross it at the opposite side of the plate (Photo 3 - 4). Each side of the cable go up and pass into the little side pulley (Photo 5 - 6) Tip Use a 2mm hexagonal screwdriver to spin the motor shaft (Photo N.9) - on both sides of iCub hips - allowing you to rotate the internal pulley (where yield the tensioners) and have it in a proper angle. To finish the wiring, position the head of the crimps inside their respective tensioners on both side of the inner part of the hips (Photo 7 - 8). To bring the joint a proper position to start correctly the routing of cable 12, please use the head screw inside the hips (Photo 9) simultaneously or one hip at a time by few degree every now and then. To arrive on the position (Photo 10) 2.3 WAIST FRONT \u2013 Cable 12 \u00b6 Procedure: Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place the cable into the slot of the pulley (Photo 12) Put the rectangular plate above the cable and secure it with 4 screws M2.5x5 hexagonal head (Photo 13). Turn the cable around the pulley taking care to cross the cable above the pulley (Photo 14). To finish the wiring, position the head of the crimps inside their respective tensioners on both side of the inner part of the hips (Photo 15 - 16) Finally, To put an end to the wiring of cable 11 and 12, just tense the 4 tensioners on which the crimps are located. Take care of tensing every one of them little by little in order to share the tension inside the tensioners in the same way. At this point, the cables of the wiring of the waist 11 and 12 is terminated and therefore it is possible to proceed with the positioning of the upper body above the latter. 2.4 WAIST TOP \u2013 Cable 13 \u00b6 Procedure: Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place it in the slot on the piece RC_TLR_001_P_243 (Photo 18).Put the plate RC_USAL_001_P_219 on the cable and secure it with 4 screws M2.5x5 hexagonal head (Photo 19). Turn the cable around the RC_TLR_001_P_243 piece taking care to cross it around the pulley, the opposite side to the plate (Photo 20).Then pass the cable through the grooves of the pulleys RC_USAL_001_P_119 (Photo 21) To Finish the wiring, draw the cable along the pulley RC_USAL_001_P_124, and place the crimp in the appropriate tensioner RC_USAL_001_P_131 (Photo 22).Do the same for the other side of the cable and cross the cable before reaching the tensioner (Photo 23). 3 LEG CABLING \u00b6 This chapter describes the steps required both during construction and in maintenance phase to route of the cables 14 of the hip of the robot and cables 15 or 16 of the ankle present on robot with lower body version 1. 3.1 HIP FLEXION \u2013 Cable 14 \u00b6 Preparation: The cable has to be previously peeled off, at a distance of 435 mm from crimp, for a total of 50 mm. (see below) Tip the latter version of iCub have a cover, you may need to remove it before proceeding(see picture below). To do that remove the 2 screws of the cover. To unscrew them it is important to see them, use a hexagonal screw driver 2mm and turn the motor shaft from the other side of the motor(see picture below). Procedure: Take the cable and place the part stripped in the slot on the piece RC_IIT_001_P_314, then center and block it with the help of the plate RC_IIT_001_P_328 (Photo 24). The shortest part of the cable is the one going outside of the robot. Take the inner part of the cable (the right one so to speak \u2013 or the longest) and make one turn around the pulley RC_IIT_001_P_314 (Photo 25). If done correctly you should have the 2 crimps reunited down below the hip (photo N.26). At this point proceed route the cables by making an 8 shape, by crossing the cables and follow the wiring (photo N.28) (shortest part - yellow cable) and insert both crimp inside their respective tensioner - piece RC_USAL_001_P_131 (Photo 27). 4.1 ANKLE FLEXION - Cable 15 or Cable 16 \u00b6 Those 2 cables are only on some previous iCub design V1. Follow the following diagram in order to rewire correctly.

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the tendons inside the Left Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons. Note Note that the cabling of (1,2) & (5,6) and (3,4) & (7,8) is identical for symmetry. Note Note also that cable E1 & E2 are indeed a one cable with two different labels at its extremities, as we will see below. 1.1.2 Cabling \u00b6 First of all, in order to increase the cable tension it is useful to unscrew the 2 couples of screws located as shown in the pictures below, depending on which cables we are working on. After having completed all the described operations the cable tension can be increased by tightening the screws again. Left arm palm down Right arm palm down In the case you found out that one of the 8 cables of the wrist broken, here the sequence you need to follow to restore it. pictures step by step guide FIRST THING: which side of the wrist is broken? The internal (refer to cables 1 to 4) or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see the differences? YOU may have guessed on your own but the answer is only that the external one is beneath the 3 proximal motors which makes it more complicated to reach and repair; apart from that it is exactly identical - so to proceed we will first see how to move the proximal motor, if you need to repair the external wrist motor, and follow up with the explanation of the tendon in a more generical way, as both motors are wired in the same way. If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually beneath them. STEP 2: remove or loose the 2 screws M2.5x8 holding the motor. From now on you can work freely. STEP 3: remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner. !!!WARNING!!! once removed, either you put back the brand new cable inside or else just simply gather the part removed from the tensioner assembly and re-screw it back in until further notice in order to DO NOT LOSE PIECES!!! We can now start wiring!!! STEP 4: Let's begin with the motor pulley. Take a piece of uncoated cable (more or less 20 cm). Let its extremities be E1 and E2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley. Block the cable on the hole H with some cyanoacrylic glue. STEP 5: Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit pulleys: the cable should be tangential to the pulleys. Block the cable on the motor with some tape. This will allow you to maintain the cable positioned on the pulley. This wiring is identical for the cables E5-E6. STEP 6: Wrist pulley (E3-E7): take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Take the other extremity (E3) and pass it trough the hole H3 on the pulley on the wrist side. Exit the pulley trough the hole H4. STEP 7: Wrap the cable as shown. The wiring of E7 is identical. STEP 8: Wrist pulley (E4-E8): take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Take the other extremity (E4) and pass it trough the hole H1 on the pulley on the wrist side. Exit the pulley trough the hole H2. STEP 9: Wrap the cable as shown. The wiring of E8 is identical. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to re-wire every single cable of the wrist you need to insert the tensioners. STEP 10: Pass E3 through the tensioner (LHS1) and tie a knot (KN3). This knot should be positioned taking into account the length of the tensioner. Remove E1 from the tape that blocks it on the motor and pass it trough the tensioner (RHS1). Tie in a knot (KN1) on E1. This knot should be positioned so as to have the tensioner in the middle of the admissible range of movements. Repeat for cables E2 &E4. STEP 11: Tight the tensioners by screwing in the extremities. 1.2 Wrist passive tendons \u00b6 1.2.1 Location & identification \u00b6 From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the Right Wrist and Left Wrist building the passive part of the wrist movements. The pink cable is cable 9 and the red one is cable 10 . Left wrist Right wrist 1.2.2 Cabling \u00b6 Here the sequence you need to follow to restore the 2 little cables from the base of the wrist - we will write down the procedure using the left arm as base pictures but use the previous pictures above to mirror the explanations. Which is the length of each cable? (Need measurements in lab) pictures step by step procedure !!!KEEP IN MIND - whenever you need to replace one of the 2 cables you FIRST need to release the tensioners . Just put one side of the crimp of each cable inside its tensioner and follow the path until its blue stopper. The X (cross) in the pictures represents a knot at the end of the cable. Cable 9 needs to be inserted inside the hole H1, while cable 10 in the hole H2. To block the cable ends you first need to unscrew the stopper (red circles), then insert the cable and screw it back. Tie in a knot in order to prevent any cable slippage. Once done: tighten the screws of both tensioners until you reach a strict tensing on the cables. 2 HAND \u00b6 2.1 Location \u00b6 The Hand wiring consists of the Thumb Oppose and the Fingers Abduction. In the picture below you can see where the cables and their respective motors are located (Left hand palm down). The minimum requirement to start recabling those 2 joints is: IITCODE Alias Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. dia 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 2.2 Thumb Oppose \u00b6 Here are the instructions for rewiring the Thumb Oppose Joint at the base of the Left Hand. pictures step by step guide STEP 1: The only way to start correctly this wiring is to remove the palm. Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 inside the palm (circled in red) and the 2 at the base of the wrist M1.6x4 (blue). STEP 2: we will now focus on the wiring along the pulley. Cut ~ 40cm of cable. Move with a screwdriver the pulley in order to have the hole (red circle) flat horizontally. Insert the cable, equilibrate evenly the cable on both sides of the pulley. The cable exits are S0 and S2 (blue circles). STEP 3: Make 1 turn around the pulley CCW to go into S2 ball bearing side 2 turns around the pulley CW to reach S0 motor side. !!!TIP: You may find convenient to remove the plate to round the cable around the pulley more easily. STEP 4: Insert both side of the cable inside S2 and S0 until they sprout out from the palm side STEP 5: Insert the cables in the central pulley at the base of the thumb as shown. STEP 6: Use a 0.7mm hexagonal key (or screwdriver) to block the cables with the set screws. !!!!CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE DONE!!! 2.3 Fingers Abduction \u00b6 Sheaths Length Label T1 38(mm) T0 T2 27(mm) T2 T3 38(mm) T3 T4 44(mm) T4 Here are the instructions for recabling the Fingers Abduction joint of the Left Hand. For the right one the procedure is mirrored. pictures step by step guide First we need to remove the hand dorsum: remove the screw M2x6 holding the dorsum cover and turn upside down the cover from the external part. Now it is necessary to remove the palm. Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 inside the palm (circled in red) and the 2 at the base of the wrist M1.6x4 (blue). Once removed the palm, remove the overall 4 set screws. Use a 0.7mm hexagonal - screwdriver or key. Remove the overall remaining pieces of the broken cable before starting to restore it and inspect inside the cage. Remove every single board above the knuckles - the MAIS board (green) and the fingertips Hall sensors (white). In details: 1. Unplug every single chipset from the main board. !!!TIP: Please write down with a marker the initial of the finger chipset you unplug - it is sometimes messy when remounting everything to find out which chipset is for which finger 2. Remove the power connector 4. With caution please remove the MAIS Board (by removing its tape) - on the bottom side of the board there is an inductor that sometimes got broken when remove carelessly. Let's get to business and Let's start wiring! Let's start from the back of the hand. Take a piece of cable (more or less 40cm) and pass it trough the central hole in the pulley (red circle). Optionally you can block the cable on the pulley putting a drop of cyanoacrylic glue into the hole. Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit holes: the cable should enter the holes tangentially. Thus, insert the cable extremities, into the two holes H1 and H2 (red circles). Pass one cable extremity trough the sheath T1 and the other one trough T2. Position the extremities of the sheaths on the sockets of the 2 exit holes in the motor support. Note: the sheath extremity should be inserted correctly in its socket. Focusing on the side of the cable inserted in the sheath T1, pass it through the tensioner and insert the sheath extremity in the tensioner socket. Then, continue the path inserting the cable through the sheath T3 until reaching a hole H3 in the hand frame (blue circle). Finally, insert the cable in the hole and position the extremity of T3 on the socket in correspondence of the hole. Twine the cable around the pulley at the base of the index finger. Pass the cable ending trough the hole H7 and exit from H8. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S9. Tie a knot about 1 cm away from the pulley. Going back to the other cable extremity inserted in the sheath T2, position the extremity of T2 on the socket in correspondence of the hole H4. Finally, insert the cable in the hole. Twine the cable around the pulley at the base of the pinkie finger. Pass the cable ending trough the hole H9 and exit from H10. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S10. Twine the cable around the little pulley and then around the pulley at the base of the ring finger. Pass the cable ending trough the hole H11 and exit from H12. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S11. Pass the cable trough the hole H5 and the sheath T4. Position the extremity of the sheath on the socket of H5. Note: the tube extremity should be inserted correctly in its socket. Pass the cable trough the hole H6 and position the extremity of T4 on the socket of H6. At this point we close the loop, reaching again the first pulley located at the base of the index. Twine the cable around the pulley and pass the cable ending trough the hole H13 and exit from H14. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S12. Tie a knot about 1cm away from the pulley. Now unscrew all the screws blocking the cable on the pulleys (S9, S10, S11 and S12). Note that this operation can be done only at a specific configuration of the fingers. At this configuration the screws are accessible thanks to suitable holes on the palm. In the picture you can see the final cable configuration on the first pulley at the base of the Index. The 2 parts of the cabled are represented by different colors. Now tension the cable: 1) Pull the blue cable from its ending. Check that the sheath is inside its sockets at H1 and H3 and block the cable extremity with the screw S9. 2) Pull the red cable from its ending. Check that the sheath is inside its sockets at H4, H5 and H6. Block the cable with the screw S10, S11 and S12. Final test: Use the head screw from the pulley motor to check if the fingers get opened-closed whenever you turn it CW or CCW. !!!!CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE DONE!!! Use every unmounting step to put back in place every part of the hand. Tip Tensioning the cable is very important. Even when all the screws are not tight, it may result difficult to tension the cable in all of its parts. This is due to the sharp edges of the pulley which do not allow a uniform distribution of the tension. Tip For the Fingers Abduction always start from the index as previously shown. Tip Each pulley at the base at the fingers has a Pin . If passing trough the holes is complicated, you can remove the finger from the palm. After this operation the pulley can be made more accessible by rotating it around its Pin. In the picture below you can see the pin of the Index pulley.","title":"Wrist & Hand Cabling V1"},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_cabling/#1-wrist","text":"","title":"1 WRIST"},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_cabling/#11-wrist-motor-tendons","text":"","title":"1.1 Wrist motor tendons"},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_cabling/#111-location-identification","text":"From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the tendons inside the Right Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons.

Left arm palm down Right arm palm down In the case you found out that one of the 8 cables of the wrist broken, here the sequence you need to follow to restore it. pictures step by step guide FIRST THING: which side of the wrist is broken? The internal (refer to cables 1 to 4) or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see the differences? YOU may have guessed on your own but the answer is only that the external one is beneath the 3 proximal motors which makes it more complicated to reach and repair; apart from that it is exactly identical - so to proceed we will first see how to move the proximal motor, if you need to repair the external wrist motor, and follow up with the explanation of the tendon in a more generical way, as both motors are wired in the same way. If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually beneath them. STEP 2: remove or loose the 2 screws M2.5x8 holding the motor. From now on you can work freely. STEP 3: remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner. !!!WARNING!!! once removed, either you put back the brand new cable inside or else just simply gather the part removed from the tensioner assembly and re-screw it back in until further notice in order to DO NOT LOSE PIECES!!! We can now start wiring!!! STEP 4: Let's begin with the motor pulley. Take a piece of uncoated cable (more or less 20 cm). Let its extremities be E1 and E2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley. Block the cable on the hole H with some cyanoacrylic glue. STEP 5: Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit pulleys: the cable should be tangential to the pulleys. Block the cable on the motor with some tape. This will allow you to maintain the cable positioned on the pulley. This wiring is identical for the cables E5-E6. STEP 6: Wrist pulley (E3-E7): take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Take the other extremity (E3) and pass it trough the hole H3 on the pulley on the wrist side. Exit the pulley trough the hole H4. STEP 7: Wrap the cable as shown. The wiring of E7 is identical. STEP 8: Wrist pulley (E4-E8): take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Take the other extremity (E4) and pass it trough the hole H1 on the pulley on the wrist side. Exit the pulley trough the hole H2. STEP 9: Wrap the cable as shown. The wiring of E8 is identical. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to re-wire every single cable of the wrist you need to insert the tensioners. STEP 10: Pass E3 through the tensioner (LHS1) and tie a knot (KN3). This knot should be positioned taking into account the length of the tensioner. Remove E1 from the tape that blocks it on the motor and pass it trough the tensioner (RHS1). Tie in a knot (KN1) on E1. This knot should be positioned so as to have the tensioner in the middle of the admissible range of movements. Repeat for cables E2 &E4.

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the Left Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons. 1.2.2 Cabling \u00b6 In the case you found out 1 of the 8 first cables of the wrist broken, here is the sequence you need to follow to restore it. Pictures step by step guide FIRST THING FIRST: Which side of the wrist is broken? The internal (refers to cables 1 to 4) or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see some visual differences? YOU may have guessed on your own, but the answer is only that the external motor is beneath the 3 proximal motors, which makes it more complicated to reach and repair. Apart from that, it is exactly identical - so to proceed we will first see how to move the proximal motors and follow up with the explanation of the tendon repair in a more generical way. If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: Remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually the motor beneath them. STEP 2: Remove the 2 screws M2.5x10 holding the motor. From now on, you can work freely. STEP 3: Remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner. !!!WARNING!!! It is the utmost importance that you DO NOT MIX the 3 parts of the tensioner. ALWAYS KEEP THEM TOGETHER the main part and its 2 screwing side STEP 4: At the level of the wrist pulley, just remove the broken cable and replace it : EASY for cable 5 and 6 BUT LESS EASY for cable 1 and 2, because you need to remove the mechanical part preventing you from inserting and removing the head crimp. To do so, just remove the 2 screws M2x6 and slide the block to retrieve and replace the head crimp. Once done, put back on place the block and the 2 screws. We can now start wiring!!! STEP 5: Let's begin with the motor pulley, here is the way to wire them both (as they are perfectly identical). LEFT ARM The BLUE cables for the Left Forearm are: 4 and 7 The RED cables for the Left Forearm are: 3 and 8 RIGHT ARM The BLUE cables for the Right Forearm are: 3 and 8 The RED cables for the Right Forearm are: 4 and 7 STEP 6: Put a 2 tie wraps one for each side (or cable) in order to prevent them from getting untwisted. picture motor almost closed on support STEP 7: Put back in place the motor with its 2 screws M2.5x10. Leave 1mm in between the motor and the support. We will cover this aspect later. STEP 8: Let's wire the wrist pulleys (either for 1,2 or 5,6) Here is the detailed wiring for the left arm, please mirror it for the right arm. The wiring is quite simple. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to rewire every single one of the wrist cables you need to insert the tensioners. Let's make the example of the 4 cables 1 to 4. STEP 9: Remove the tie wrap at the level of the motor wrist, for let's say cable 3. Open one side of the tensioner and start putting the ring, then the threaded piece of the tensioner, finish by screwing the ring onto the threaded piece. Do the exact same for the cable 1. STEP 10: Screw both pieces into the main tensioner part - Let's say just 2 threads on both sides, just to make it hold until we tense it. STEP 11: Repeat STEP 9 and STEP 10 with cables 2 and 4. STEP 12: Use 2 pliers to hold on the tips of the threaded pieces' tensioner and use with any tool fitting the hole inside the main part of the tensioner AND finally screw them. !!! TIP !!! depending on how you are facing the cables just screw CW or CCW for half a turn to understand if the 2 threaded pieces are going inside the main piece or if they get out - THEY NEED TO GET IN OBVIOUSLY. Repeat the above step on both tensioners until you get a quite nice tensing (but not super tense, this will be done right next). FINAL STEP: Tense the 2 screws that we left a bit opened on STEP 7. 1.3 WRIST - PASSIVE TENDONS \u00b6 1.3.1 Location and Identification \u00b6 From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the Right Wrist and Left Wrist building the passive part of the wrist movements.

Pictures step by step procedure !!!KEEP IN MIND!!! whenever you need to replace one of the 2 cables you FIRST need to release the tensioners . CABLE 10: it is really straight forward - just put one side of the crimp of cable 10 inside the tensioner (blue circle) and put the other side inside the holding tooth. CABLE 9: it is just a bit more complicated because you need to first remove the screw to be able to lodge the crimp inside the tensioner and put back in place the tensioner in the throat and insert the screw. Once done: tighten the screws of both tensioners until you reach a strict tensing on the cables. 2 HAND \u00b6 2.1 Location \u00b6 The minimum requirement to start re-cabling those 2 joints is: IITCODE Alias Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel micro-cable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. diameter 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 2.2 THUMB OPPOSE \u00b6 As usual, you will find here after the instructions for rewiring the Thump oppose joint at base of the Left Hand. Pictures step by step guide STEP 1: The only way to start correctly this wiring is to remove the palm. Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 (circled in red) inside the palm and the 2 screws M2x4 (circled in blue) at the base of the wrist. STEP 2 : We will now focus on the wiring along the pulley. Cut 50 to 60cm of ITTCODE 1815. Move with a screwdriver the pulley in order to have the hole flat horizontally. Insert the cable, divide equally the cable from part to part of the pulley. STEP 3: DO 1 turn around the pulley CCW to go into S2 ball-bearing side 2 turns around the pulley CW to reach S0 motor side !!!TIP: You may find convenient to remove the plate to round the cable around the pulley more easily. STEP 4: Insert both sides of the cable inside S2 and S0 until they sprout out from the palm side. !!!!TIP: once both sides of the cables are out at the base of the palm, you may find convenient to verify the turns around the pulley ( you could use 2 pieces of foam hear plugs to prevent the cable from unwired itself) - Make sure the plate is screwed back into normal state. STEP 5: The cable from S0 goes directly into hole T1. The cable from S2 makes 1 FULL TURN around the pulley before going into T2. STEP 6: Use a 0.7mm hexagonal key (or screwdriver) to block the cables. !!!TIP: you may find useful to first block one side and afterwards use a plier to exert a strong pulling of the wire to tense this other side of the cable and block it. Repeat the the same process on the other side. !!!!CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE DONE!!! 2.3 FINGERS ABDUCTION \u00b6 PREFACE: This cable is THE most complicated to replace - rewire, mainly because you need to unmount a lot of parts BUT on the other hand it is also the most reliable - You may never need to replace it. Pictures step by step guide STEP 1: remove the screw M2x6 holding the dorsum cover and turn upside down the cover from the external part. The dorsum cover should get removed. STEP 2: The only way to start correctly this wiring is to remove the palm. Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 inside the palm (circled in red) and the 2 screws M2x4 (circled in blue) at base of the wrist. STEP 3: remove the overall set screws. Use a 0.7mm hexagonal - screwdriver or key. STEP 4: remove the overall remaining pieces of the broken cable before starting to restore it. Inspect inside the cage - remove the 2 screws M1.6x5. Let's get to business and Let's start wiring! STEP 5: start wiring: 2 Full Turns (blue) CCW around the pulley and it gets out into tube T2 1 Full Turn (red) CW around the pulley and it gets out into tube T0. !!!TIP!!! It could be a good idea to block the wiring around the pulley thx to some foam earplug or some paper. Here is a picture of the overall path of the cable inside the 3 tubes constituting the path of the cable. STEP 6: remove every single board above the knuckle. STEP 6a: remove the screw and flip over the board with the little chipsets. STEP 6b: 1. Unplug every single chipset from the main board !!!TIP: Please write down with a marker the initial of the finger chipset you unplug - it sometimes a bit messy when remounting everything to find out which chipset is for which finger. 2. remove the power connector 3. remove the 3 screws (2 M1x5 and 1 M1.6x6) 4. With caution please remove the MAIS Board - on the bottom side of the board there is an inductor that sometimes got broken when removed carelessly. STEP 6c: remove the 2 screws M1.6x6 Let's start with wiring the cable from T2 STEP 7: Here is the picture of the routing of the cable you need to realize. To do that, it is necessary to allow the pulleys to rotate around their pin. STEP 7a: PINKIE FINGER 1. you need to untighten ENTIRELY the axes screws on both sides of the finger (on the palm side it can be removed - pay attention that the ball bearing may fall as well, just remember to replace it when remounting - BUT REFRAIN TO REMOVE on top side - or else you will lose the center of the finger) 2. try to move the pulley along its pin until you succeed to insert the cable into it. 3. Put back on the axes screws and retighten them. STEP 7b: RING FINGER Same 3 first steps as the Pinkie finger. 4. Finally insert the cable into the hole leading to T4. STEP 8: Before starting to wire the base of the index finger it is really important to block the cable at the base of the pinkie finger - in this way we wont unintentionally untwine the wiring at the level of the motor pulley. 1. Insert the set-screw onto the pinkie finger and tighten it.. Let's start wiring the index base pulley STEP 9: As for pinkie and ring fingers: 1. untighten the 2 axes screws in order to be able to move the pink (color) pulley sideways around its PIN 2. Pass the cable coming from T4 (red) inside the pulley hole. STEP 10: 1. wire the cable from T0 (blue) 2. re-center the pinky pulley 3. put the axes screw back on. Let's start tensing the cable STEP 11: 1. take one plier - pinch at the exit of the cable from the pinky pulley and twist it to retrieve the excess of cable which will have for consequence to tense this part of the cable - the overall fingers should get closer to each other 2. put the set-screw A and B 3. Tense the other side of the cable (blue part) the same way 4. put the set-screw C STEP 12: Final test: 1. remove the 2 blocks (foam ear plug or paper jamming) from the pulley motor 2. use the head screw from the pulley motor to check if the fingers get opened-closed whenever you turn it CW or CCW.

Pictures step by step guide FIRST THING FIRST: Which side of the wrist is broken? The internal (refers to cables 1 to 4) or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see some visual differences? YOU may have guessed on your own, but the answer is only that the external motor is beneath the 3 proximal motors, which makes it more complicated to reach and repair. Apart from that, it is exactly identical - so to proceed we will first see how to move the proximal motors and follow up with the explanation of the tendon repair in a more generical way. If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: Remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually the motor beneath them. STEP 2: Remove the 2 screws M2.5x10 holding the motor. From now on, you can work freely. STEP 3: Remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner. !!!WARNING!!! It is the utmost importance that you DO NOT MIX the 3 parts of the tensioner. ALWAYS KEEP THEM TOGETHER the main part and its 2 screwing side STEP 4: At the level of the wrist pulley, just remove the broken cable and replace it : EASY for cable 5 and 6 BUT LESS EASY for cable 1 and 2, because you need to remove the mechanical part preventing you from inserting and removing the head crimp. To do so, just remove the 2 screws M2x6 and slide the block to retrieve and replace the head crimp. Once done, put back on place the block and the 2 screws. We can now start wiring!!! STEP 5: Let's begin with the motor pulley, here is the way to wire them both (as they are perfectly identical). LEFT ARM The BLUE cables for the Left Forearm are: 4 and 7 The RED cables for the Left Forearm are: 3 and 8 RIGHT ARM The BLUE cables for the Right Forearm are: 3 and 8 The RED cables for the Right Forearm are: 4 and 7 STEP 6: Put a 2 tie wraps one for each side (or cable) in order to prevent them from getting untwisted. picture motor almost closed on support STEP 7: Put back in place the motor with its 2 screws M2.5x10. Leave 1mm in between the motor and the support. We will cover this aspect later. STEP 8: Let's wire the wrist pulleys (either for 1,2 or 5,6) Here is the detailed wiring for the left arm, please mirror it for the right arm. The wiring is quite simple. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to rewire every single one of the wrist cables you need to insert the tensioners. Let's make the example of the 4 cables 1 to 4. STEP 9: Remove the tie wrap at the level of the motor wrist, for let's say cable 3. Open one side of the tensioner and start putting the ring, then the threaded piece of the tensioner, finish by screwing the ring onto the threaded piece. Do the exact same for the cable 1. STEP 10: Screw both pieces into the main tensioner part - Let's say just 2 threads on both sides, just to make it hold until we tense it. STEP 11: Repeat STEP 9 and STEP 10 with cables 2 and 4. STEP 12: Use 2 pliers to hold on the tips of the threaded pieces' tensioner and use with any tool fitting the hole inside the main part of the tensioner AND finally screw them. !!! TIP !!! depending on how you are facing the cables just screw CW or CCW for half a turn to understand if the 2 threaded pieces are going inside the main piece or if they get out - THEY NEED TO GET IN OBVIOUSLY. Repeat the above step on both tensioners until you get a quite nice tensing (but not super tense, this will be done right next).

CABLE 10: it is really straight forward - just put one side of the crimp of cable 10 inside the tensioner (blue circle) and put the other side inside the holding tooth. CABLE 9: it is just a bit more complicated because you need to first remove the screw to be able to lodge the crimp inside the tensioner and put back in place the tensioner in the throat and insert the screw.

STEP 4: Insert both sides of the cable inside S2 and S0 until they sprout out from the palm side. !!!!TIP: once both sides of the cables are out at the base of the palm, you may find convenient to verify the turns around the pulley ( you could use 2 pieces of foam hear plugs to prevent the cable from unwired itself) - Make sure the plate is screwed back into normal state. STEP 5: The cable from S0 goes directly into hole T1. The cable from S2 makes 1 FULL TURN around the pulley before going into T2. STEP 6: Use a 0.7mm hexagonal key (or screwdriver) to block the cables. !!!TIP: you may find useful to first block one side and afterwards use a plier to exert a strong pulling of the wire to tense this other side of the cable and block it.

It could be a good idea to block the wiring around the pulley thx to some foam earplug or some paper. Here is a picture of the overall path of the cable inside the 3 tubes constituting the path of the cable. STEP 6: remove every single board above the knuckle. STEP 6a: remove the screw and flip over the board with the little chipsets. STEP 6b: 1. Unplug every single chipset from the main board !!!TIP: Please write down with a marker the initial of the finger chipset you unplug - it sometimes a bit messy when remounting everything to find out which chipset is for which finger. 2. remove the power connector 3. remove the 3 screws (2 M1x5 and 1 M1.6x6) 4.
